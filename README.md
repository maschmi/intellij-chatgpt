This plugin allows you to open a conversation with ChatGpt in a tool window. Currently the conversation is not
stored anywhere and will be lost once you close the IDE. You need a ChatGPT API key to use this plugin. Please
configure it under settings.

Later plans for this plugin are:
* storing the conversation
* add a context menu action to ask about the selected code

Requirements:
* ChatGPT Api Key

Disclaimer:
This plugin mainly serves me as a toy project to get familiar with IntelliJ plugins.
